## Create a local side branch
1. In VS code click bottom left corner on the branch icon.\
   <img src="./Images/BranchIcon.jpg" alt="Branch Icon">
2. Select "+ Create new branch from"\
   ![NewBranch](./Images/NewBranch.png)
3. Type a meaningful new branch name and press enter\
   ![NewBranchName](./Images/NewBranchName.png)
4. Select the branch from which you want to create a new branch. Most likely this will be "Main branch" from Origin online (Main branch in DevOps).\
   ![NewBranchFrom](./Images/CreateFromMain.png)

   >The active branch is now the new created branch (see bottom left corner), based on the situation of the main branch. 

## Commit your changes to your online side branch
1. Work on your Code as usual. 
2. Commit your new branch with your code changes to DevOps.
   - There is a commit signal\
   ![CommitSignal](./Images/CommitSignal.png)
     > If your new (local) side branch was not yet synced to the online repository then that will happen along with your first changes following the steps below. 
   - Choose the changes that you want to `'Stage'` by clicking on the `'+' Icon`. Staging means basically that you line up these changes to be send to your online repository.\

   - The `Staged` changes are now ready to be send to the online repository. Provide a short meaningfull name for your commit and click the `V Icon`.\
   ![StagedChanges](./Images/StagedChanges.jpg)
3. Now sync your local changes with the online version by clicking 'Sync Changes'.\

4. You can continue working on your local side branch whenever you want.

### Pull Request: add your side branch changes to main branch
> The following steps are performed online in Azure DevOps. Once you think your side code is ready for review and to merge to the main branch you can create a `pull request` on DevOps
1. Go to DevOps online environment; Click "Repos" and then "Pull Requests"\
![Branches](./Images/ReposPullRequests.jpg)
2. Click button "New Pull Request".\
   ![NewPullRequest](./Images/NewPullRequest.jpg)
3. Fill in details in the popup and click "Create"\
   ![PullRequestDetails](./Images/PullRequestDetails.jpg)
   > Make sure you request to do a pull from the correct branch into the correct other branch
4. Review and perform the action (Approve or Reject)\
   ![ApprovePullRequest](./Images/ApprovePullRequest.jpg)
5. When approved, click button "Complete" or "Set auto-complete.
6. Check/Uncheck the options you wish and click "Complete".\
   ![CompletionOptions](./Images/CompletionOptions.jpg)
7.  Depending on the set branch policies, the main branch is updated with the changes made in the side branch. 
<br>
    > **Note:** When the branch policies are set in such a way that multiple reviewers need to approve the changes, then the main branch is updated only once all reviewers have approved the changes. 

### Main Branch Policies
Branch policies are an important part of the Git workflow and enable us to:
- Isolate work in progress from the completed work in your main branch
- Guarantee changes build before they get to main
- Limit who can contribute to specific branches
- Enforce who can create branches and the naming guidelines for the branches
- Automatically include the right reviewers for every code change
- Enforce best practices with required code reviewers
  
We have set the following branch policies on the main branch in the repo section
- **Require minumum number of reviewers**
  - value = 2: we are working with 2 developers on this branch
  - Allow requesters to approve their own changes
    - value = Yes; because it's just 2 devolopers working on this branch. Besides we force the requester to review his own changes.
  
   ![MinimumReviewers](./Images/NumberReviewers.jpg)

- **Check for linked work items**
  - Value = Required; all commits and code review are then tracked in the board workitem of the developer in question. 
  
  ![LinkedWorkitem](./Images/LinkedWorkItems.jpg)

- **Check for comment resolution**
  - Value = Required; all individual commmits have to be reviewd. 
  
  ![CommentResolution](./Images/CommentResolution.jpg)

- **Limit merge types**
  - Allowed merge types is `Squash merge` only.
  - This means that on the master branch line only sub lines are shown for pull requests and not for every commit in a particular pull request.
  - This gives a much cleaner branch line to review where changes were made.
